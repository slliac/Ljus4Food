\section*{Technological Specification }



 Frontend development 



Vue.\+js is used for the project \textquotesingle{}s frontend architecture.\+As well as its flexbility and also strong resource fulfillment and support,supported together with Vuetify Framework,which is a material based design framework



 Backend development 



P\+HP with \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_code_igniter}{Code\+Igniter}} would be used as its M\+VC Structure and its convience to corp with A\+PI struff with Curl/\+O\+Auth 2.\+0,and easier to managed json afterwards.



 Testing 



In terms of testing,\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_p_h_p_unit}{P\+H\+P\+Unit}} would be used as it supports with multiple platforms,the work that we assume the covered rates should be high(Usually About 60-\/70\% for coverage in large scale web development for success commerical products).



 Version Control 



Git would be used and gitlab would be the platform that I did the version control.



 Server Requirements 



P\+HP version 5.\+6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.\+3.\+7 as well, but we strongly advise you N\+OT to run such old versions of P\+HP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.
