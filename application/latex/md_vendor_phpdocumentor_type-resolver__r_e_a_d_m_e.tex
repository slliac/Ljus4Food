The specification on types in Doc\+Blocks (P\+S\+R-\/5) describes various keywords and special constructs but also how to statically resolve the partial name of a Class into a Fully Qualified Class Name (F\+Q\+CN).

P\+S\+R-\/5 also introduces an additional way to describe deeper elements than Classes, Interfaces and Traits called the Fully Qualified Structural Element Name (F\+Q\+S\+EN). Using this it is possible to refer to methods, properties and class constants but also functions and global constants.

This package provides two Resolvers that are capable of


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Returning a series of Value Object for given expression while resolving any partial class names, and
\item Returning an F\+Q\+S\+EN object after resolving any partial Structural Element Names into Fully Qualified Structural Element names.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Installing}

The easiest way to install this library is with \href{https://getcomposer.org}{\tt Composer} using the following command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ composer require phpdocumentor/type-resolver
\end{DoxyVerb}

\subsection*{On Types and Element Names}

This component can be used in one of two ways


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item To resolve a Type or
\item To resolve a Fully Qualified Structural Element Name
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The big difference between these two is in the number of things it can resolve.

The Type\+Resolver can resolve\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a php primitive or pseudo-\/primitive such as a string or void (\`{} 
\end{DoxyItemize}
